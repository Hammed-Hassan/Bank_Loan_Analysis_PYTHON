![Alt text for the image](https://github.com/Hammed-Hassan/Bank_Loan_Analysis/blob/main/Bank%20Loan%20Pictures.jpg)

## âœ…Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of a loan portfolio to identify key performance indicators (KPIs) and uncover insights into lending trends, borrower demographics, and loan health. The analysis is driven by a data-first approach, utilizing Python and its robust data science libraries to deliver actionable business intelligence. The entire analysis, from data wrangling to visualization, was performed in a Jupyter Notebook, which is included in this repository.

#
### âœ…Problem Statement & Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- Total Loan Applications: Calculation of total applications and Month-to-Date (MTD) figures.
- Total Funded Amount: Calculation of total funds disbursed and MTD figures.
- Total Amount Received: Tracking of total repayments from borrowers and MTD figures.
- Average Interest Rate: Computation of the average interest rate across all loans to assess the overall cost of the lending portfolio.
- Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI): Evaluation of the average DTI to gauge the financial health of borrowers.
- Line/Area Chart showing Monthly Trends by Issue Date
- Bar Chart showing Regional Analysis by State
- Donut Chart showing Loan Term Analysis
- Bar Chart showing Employee Length Analysis
- Bar Chart showing Loan Purpose Breakdown
- Tree map showing Home Ownership Analysis

#
### âœ…Solving with Python: The Code
1. Total Loan Applications
```python code
total_loan_application = df['id'].count()
print("Total Loan Applications:", total_loan_application)
```
2. Total Funded Amount
```python code
total_funded_amount = df['loan_amount'].sum()
total_funded_amount_millions = total_funded_amount/1000000 
print(f"Total Funded Amount: ${total_funded_amount_millions:.2f}M")
```
3. Total Amount Received
```python code
total_loan_application = df['id'].count()
print("Total Loan Applications:", total_loan_application)
```
MTD Total Loan Applications
```python code
latest_issue_date = df['issue_date'].max()
latest_year = latest_issue_date.year
latest_month = latest_issue_date.month

mtd_data = df[(df['issue_date'].dt.year == latest_year) & (df['issue_date'].dt.month == latest_month)]

mtd_loan_appliactions = mtd_data['id'].count()

print(f"MTD Loan Applications(for {latest_issue_date.strftime('%B %Y')}): {mtd_loan_appliactions}")
```
MTD Total Funded Amount
```python code
latest_issue_date = df['issue_date'].max()
latest_year = latest_issue_date.year
latest_month = latest_issue_date.month

mtd_data = df[(df['issue_date'].dt.year == latest_year) & (df['issue_date'].dt.month == latest_month)]

mtd_total_funded_amount = mtd_data['loan_amount'].sum()
total_funded_amount_millions = mtd_total_funded_amount/1000000 
print(f"MTD Total Funded Amount: ${total_funded_amount_millions:.2f}M")
```
MTD Total Amount Received
```python code
latest_issue_date = df['issue_date'].max()
latest_year = latest_issue_date.year
latest_month = latest_issue_date.month

mtd_data = df[(df['issue_date'].dt.year == latest_year) & (df['issue_date'].dt.month == latest_month)]

mtd_total_amount_recieved = mtd_data['total_payment'].sum()
mtd_total_amount_recieved_millions = mtd_total_amount_recieved/1000000 
print(f"Total Funded Amount: ${mtd_total_amount_recieved_millions:.2f}M")
```
4. Average Interest Rate
```python code
average_interest_rate = df['int_rate'].mean()*100
print(f"Avg Int Rate: {average_interest_rate:.2f}")
```
5. Average debt-to-Income Ration (DTI)
```python code
average_dti = df['dti'].mean()*100
print(f"Avg DTI: {average_dti:.2f}%")
```

### âœ…Good and Bad Loan Metrics
Good Loan metrics
```python code
good_loan = df[df['loan_status'].isin(['Fully Paid', 'Current'])]
total_loan_applications = df['id'].count()

good_loan_applications = good_loan['id'].count()
good_loan_funded_amount = good_loan['loan_amount'].sum()
good_loan_received = good_loan['total_payment'].sum()

good_loan_funded_amount_millions = good_loan_funded_amount / 1000000
good_loan_received_millions = good_loan_received / 1000000

good_loan_percentage = (good_loan_applications / total_loan_applications) * 100

print(f"Good Loan Applications:{good_loan_applications}")
print(f"Good Loan Funded Amount(in Millions):${good_loan_funded_amount_millions:.2f}M")
print(f"Good Loan Total Received (in Millions):${good_loan_received_millions:.2f}M")
print(f"Percentage of Good Loan Applications:{good_loan_percentage:.2f}%")
```

Bad Loan Metrics
```python code
bad_loan = df[df['loan_status'].isin(['Charged Off'])]
total_loan_applications = df['id'].count()

bad_loan_applications = bad_loan['id'].count()
bad_loan_funded_amount = bad_loan['loan_amount'].sum()
bad_loan_received = bad_loan['total_payment'].sum()

bad_loan_funded_amount_millions = bad_loan_funded_amount / 1000000
bad_loan_received_millions = bad_loan_received / 1000000

bad_loan_percentage = (bad_loan_applications / total_loan_applications) * 100

print(f"bad Loan Applications:{bad_loan_applications}")
print(f"bad Loan Funded Amount(in Millions):${bad_loan_funded_amount_millions:.2f}M")

#
### âœ…Key Trends and Data Insights
- Growing Loan Demand: The total funded amount shows a strong upward trend, increasing from $25.03 million in January to $53.98 million in December, an increase of 116% over the year.
- Dominance of Shorter-Term Loans: 36-month loans account for 62.7% of the total funded amount, representing $273 million, while 60-month loans make up the remaining 37.3% or $162.7 million.
- Debt Consolidation is the Primary Purpose: Loans for debt consolidation are the most significant, totaling $232 million, which is approximately 4 times more than the next highest purpose, "credit card" at $59 million.
- Experienced Employees Drive Funding: Individuals with 10+ years of employment history received the highest total funded amount at $116.1K, more than double the amount received by any other employment length group.
- Geographic Concentration: Lending activity is heavily concentrated in a few key states, with California (CA) alone receiving $78.484K in funded amounts, significantly higher than other states.
- Homeownership Segments: The MORTGAGE and RENT segments represent the largest funded amounts, collectively dominating the portfolio by a large margin over the OWN segment.

#
### âœ…Recommendations
- Capitalize on Key Markets: Focus marketing and outreach efforts on the top-performing states, as California, New York, and Texas represent a significant concentration of the total funded amount.
- Develop Targeted Products: Launch dedicated loan products for debt consolidation, which accounts for over $232M in funded loans.
- Optimize for High-Value Borrowers: Create tailored loan offerings for borrowers with 10+ years of employment history, as this group represents the highest total funded amount at $116.1K.
- Expand Loan Term Offerings: Strategically review and adjust pricing for 60-month loans to increase their market share, which currently sits at 37.3% of the portfolio.

#
### âœ…Conclusion
- Portfolio Growth: The loan portfolio is healthy and in a period of sustained growth, with the total funded amount increasing by over 116% in 2021.
- Primary Drivers Identified: The analysis successfully identified the primary drivers of the portfolio, including debt consolidation as the top loan purpose and 36-month terms as the most popular loan length.
- Strategic Opportunity: The data provides a clear roadmap for future growth by highlighting opportunities to increase market share in specific geographic regions and among key borrower segments.
- Overall Health: The portfolio is a robust and expanding operation with clear, quantifiable trends that can be leveraged for future strategic planning.
